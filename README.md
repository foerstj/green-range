# green-range
A Dungeon Siege map based in the Green Range mountains.

FOSS, CC-BY-SA.

## Requirements & installation
Requires _Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna_.

To install, put the dsmap & dsres files into the DSLOA folder of your installation directory.

## Notes
This map is in large parts auto-generated.
The algorithm generates the mountain terrain and automatically places plants and enemies,
based on Perlin noise. I then add things like bridges and caves, NPCs and minibosses.

This means that the pacing / balancing and the level design are not meticulously hand-crafted.
Please keep that in mind.
The terrain structure will contain dead ends, and I will try to close them off,
but do not expect a reward chest at each dead end.
Chances are you will simply have to walk all the way back to the Klars Trail empty-handed.

Another note, the nights are quite dark out there in the mountains.
They are not scripted for particular areas, but are based on the day-night cycle of DS,
which takes about 38 minutes (1.6 real minutes per world hour).
So if it bothers you and hinders exploration, you can simply wait a while.
(Depending on playtester feedback I might also try to implement a light spell, but let's see.)
