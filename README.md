## About
_The Green Range is a mountain range on the continent of Aranna that marks the southeastern border of the Aranoi Desert.
The mountains dominate northern Ehb, where they collide with the imposing Frostspire Mountain.
Many of Ehb's notable landmarks, including Glitterdelve, Glacern, Fedwyrr's Way, Fortress Kroth, and the Dark Forest,
are located within the bounds of the Green Range.\
The Droog inhabited the Green Range for centuries, but following the Green Range Conflict in 604,
they were driven from the region by colonists from the Empire of Stars, and forced into the Cliffs of Fire to the south._

Beyond the borders of Ehb, the Green Range extends far north-east,
and the Klars Trail leads all the way through them to distant Longbourne.
To the south-east side lies the Greylin Bay, to the north-west side the Aranoi Desert.\
Out in this rugged, forested wilderness, there's no king and no country.
Only the hardy Rangers and the Dwarves of Umberdeep call these mountains their home.
So do Krug, Robbers, Giants, and hordes of Trolls.

This is a casual, atmospheric map for both singleplayer and multiplayer.
It provides a variety of forest biomes, and lots of branching paths and side areas to wander around in and explore.\
Enjoy playing and don't get lost!

## Notes
This map is in large parts auto-generated.
The algorithm generates the mountain terrain and automatically places plants and enemies,
based on Perlin noise. I then added things like bridges and caves, NPCs and minibosses.

This means that the pacing / balancing and the level design are not meticulously hand-crafted.
Please keep that in mind.
The terrain structure will contain dead ends, and I will not bother to close them all off,
also do not expect a reward chest at each dead end.
Chances are you will simply have to walk all the way back to the Klars Trail empty-handed.

Another note, the nights are quite dark out there in the mountains.
They are not scripted for particular areas, but are based on the day-night cycle of DS,
which takes about 38 minutes (1.6 real minutes per world hour).
So if it bothers you and hinders exploration, you can simply wait a while.\
Alternatively, you can make use of the Light spell, which is available in shops.
