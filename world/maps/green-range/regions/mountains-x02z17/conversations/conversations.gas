The Trail leads through a cave full of undead skeletons right over there. Don't worry, they're harmless.
If you take a left turn in the cave and exit to the west, you'll find one of our shacks there. You can spend the night there if you want. Common sense applies: please leave the place no dirtier than you found it, and please close the door behind you to keep the Krug out.";

Sorry, the mule stays with me. The Dwarves will probably sell you one if you ask there.";
