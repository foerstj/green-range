A Curse was laid upon them, taking away their long lifespans and reducing their stature. 
As the outcasts, who were exclusively men, had to mate with other races to produce any offspring, and our offspring is also exclusively male by nature of the Curse, these traits were watered down even more. Today, none of us reaches three meters in height or two hundred years of age.

Maybe one day our race will go extinct. Maybe it's for the better.";
