        description = "The journeys and discoveries of the Agallan explorers Fedwyrr and Klars are legendary. One of their many renouned deeds is the discovery of a passage traversing the length of the Green Range mountains, which began at the outskirts of the Empire of Stars and led far south-west, between the forbidding Aranoi Desert and the treacherous shores of the Greilyn Bay, to a land hitherto undiscovered by both the Empire of Stars and the Utraean Empire, only inhabited by seemingly primitive Natives that called the lands Ehb and themselves Droog.
Since its discovery, the route enjoyed a small but steady stream of travelers, merchants, pioneers and adventurers. Rangers started living in the mountains; Longbourne was founded; Dwarves dug through Mount Umberdeep and stayed for the gold they found. During the War of the Legions, when the Empire of Stars crumbled and fell, this was the route the 10th Legion went to found their new kingdom.
Today, the long and mostly overground trail between Longbourne and the borders of Ehb is called the Klars Trail, and the way through the cold and slippery caverns in the north of the Kingdom are called Fedwyrr's Way, in their memory.";
